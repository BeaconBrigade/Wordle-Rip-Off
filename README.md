# Wordle-Rip-Off
This is a Wordle clone. Made using Guizero

## Installation ##

You will need both the src and resource directories to run the project.

You will also need Guizero and the Python CSV libraries installed.

## Issue ##

Running on a Mac, in `main.py` you will need to change all of the `with open()` 
statements to have a `../` at the start of the directory in order for them to open.
